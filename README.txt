DosVM is an "emulation" program that permits you to run a complete VM from a command prompt window.

DosVM has an integrated OS called DosVM System, made entirely in ascii!

HOW TO INSTALL:

1) Create a folder called "ntntp"
2) Open "First Launch.exe"
3) After configuring, run DosVM.exe

Errors:

1) No boot devce found
This may be an update corrupted your disk, just restart DosVM

2) Bootloop
Restart DosVM

3) System restore
When installing a custom OS, the installer may crash, just wait till it finish to restore the old system.

Thanks for trying DosVM :)
